# Audio Signal AM Demo

**End-to-end demonstration of audio signal transmission using Amplitude Modulation (AM)**

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a system for transmitting audio signals using amplitude modulation (AM). It includes a transmitter that modulates audio onto a carrier wave generated by a function generator and a receiver that demodulates and reproduces the original audio signal.

## Detailed Description
For a comprehensive description of the project, including theoretical background, design, and implementation details, please refer to the [project report](https://github.com/ihdavjar/AudioSignalAMDemo/blob/308a2fdff520fb33e8acf8d6c2de1cf82c4228f1/Resources/Report/Final_Report.pdf).

## Simulation
A simulation of the system can be found on Falstad. Below is a GIF demonstrating the modulation and demodulation processes:

Falstad circuits for both amplitude modulation and demodulation can be found in the `Resources/Falstad` directory. These can be opened using [Falstad](https://www.falstad.com/circuit/).
